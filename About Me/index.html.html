    <h2> Erik Ryan Ellefson </h2>
    <h3>I am starting my tract for programming and web design I intitially was in the mechanical engineering program, but came to the realization that it was not for me. I was curious about programming and wanted to give it a rrie, since I have always loved technology and so far I have been enjoying it. I have served a mission and had the opportunity to serve in two places; Mendoza, Argentina; and Las Vegas, Nevada. Covid is the only necessary explaination for that. This is my third semester here in BYUI and what I love the most about it is its focus on our spiritual welfare, having been in other schools the simple thing of starting a class with a prayer changes a lot when it comes to the learning enviroment and I really apreciate that.</h3>
